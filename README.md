# EN-Machine-Learning

This repository is for people who seek to demystify and explain the most common Machine Learning algorithms.
Machine Learning is extremely useful, and there are plenty of libraries (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow,...) that allow us to do simple and exciting problem solving. However, I do believe that it is equally as important to learn how these Algorithms work.

I am going to explain in simple terms some of the most well-known algorithms. I'm going to show you the math behind it, as well as how easy it is to code something simple yet extremely useful. All of the programing will be done in Python.

There are currently two algorithms you can check out:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

There are many more to come, alongside some more advance topics that I will want to show you all.


If you see any errors, please let me know so that I can make the appropriate changes. Thank you and good luck on your Machine Learning adventures.
